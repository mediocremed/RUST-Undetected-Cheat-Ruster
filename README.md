## 💪 Features of the Ruster

### 🎯 Rust Aimbot

The **Rust Aimbot** module ensures precision shooting even in fast-paced combat. Built for flexibility and human-like movement, this module is completely customizable.

* **Target Locking:** Locks on to enemies for instant response.
* **Smooth Aim:** Adjustable smoothing to mimic natural motion.
* **FOV Customization:** Define aim zones for precision.
* **Bone Selection:** Head, neck, or chest targeting.
* **Toggleable:** Activate or deactivate via hotkey.

### 🔍 Rust ESP

The **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** system gives you complete environmental awareness.

* **Player ESP:** Shows player names, distance, and team status.
* **Item ESP:** Highlights valuable items like weapons, loot crates, and resources.
* **Animal ESP:** Shows wild animals for hunting or avoidance.
* **Corpse ESP:** Locate downed enemies or allies.
* **Health Bars:** View player health in real time.

### 🕳 Rust Wallhack

Never be caught off guard. The **Rust Wallhack** feature allows you to see through solid surfaces.

* **Transparent Wall Vision:** See player movement behind structures.
* **Distance-Based Rendering:** Customize how far through walls ESP can work.
* **Configurable Transparency:** Change color and opacity.
* **Safe Render Mode:** Prevents anti-cheat detection through external overlays.

### 🏋 Rust No Recoil

Recoil ruins accuracy. The **Rust No Recoil** system eliminates the pattern shaking found in Rust's gunplay.

* **100% Recoil Compensation:** Remove all vertical and horizontal recoil.
* **Optional Spread Control:** Reduce bullet spread for even tighter aim.
* **Toggle Recoil System:** Enable/disable instantly.
* **Humanized Mode:** Slight recoil remaining to appear legitimate.

## 🚀 Compatibility

This project is designed to run flawlessly across all modern PC configurations:

* ✅ Windows 10 and 11
* ✅ All CPU types (Intel & AMD)
* ✅ Compatible with all motherboards
* ✅ Works in Fullscreen and StreamerMode
* ✅ Functions with old game versions (auto-offset fallback)
* ✅ Fast update-time compensation after patches

---

## 🚗 Status: Undetected

The Rust Cheat is fully external and modular, utilizing overlay rendering and non-invasive memory reading. This allows the cheat to remain **undetected by EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat)** through:

* No direct game injection
* Driver-based HW read access
* Randomized encryption
* External rendering

Stay undetected longer with a cheat designed for stealth.
